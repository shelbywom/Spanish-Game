Download the full project from the repository. The game has WebGL support but is tied to a local host.
You can access the project through the Unity Hub or through Assets>Scenes>MainMenu.
Once the game page loads, you'll see the title screen with various options.
Look for the "JUGAR" button or text prompting you to start the game.

To move Mario left or right, use the left and right arrow keys on your keyboard.
Press the up arrow key to make Mario jump over obstacles and enemies.

Playing the Level:

As you progress through the level, you'll encounter various obstacles, enemies, and power-ups.
Jump over pits, avoid enemies, and collect coins to earn points.
Your goal is to reach the end of the level while maximizing your score.

Pause Screen:

During gameplay, you can pause the game by pressing the "P" key or another designated key.
The pause screen will appear, providing options to manage the game.
You'll see buttons labeled "JUGAR" to resume playing, "Opciones" to access settings, and "Abandonar" to quit the game. (IP)
